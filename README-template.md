## My process

### Built with

-  Semantic HTML5 markup
-  CSS custom properties
-  Flexbox
-  Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Containers are your friend!

### Continued development

Possible tweak section 2 a little bit to make the inbetween sizes look a little more polished.
Also, the active/hover states on the li's. The images from the documents show a shorter line than what I have made and I need to fiddle with it. Probably using ::after
